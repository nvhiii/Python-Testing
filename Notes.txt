# Lecture 14: Classes and Attributes

## Attributes

- thing to add attributes to

## Optional parameters

- all function parameters are general required

  e.g. of reg parameter

  def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, (name)!")

- Function parameters can optionally be given default values. If a parameter has a default value, it is no longer required when the function is called with a param

    (default param must always come last, because it allows for calling of the method with no param, so default)

    e.g. or a optional parameter

    def say_hello(name = "Nahi"):
      print(f"Hello, (name)!")


Classes (integration, how they are designed, how useful they are)

Class design exercise: Time

Attributes:
  - Hours
  - Minutes
  - Seconds

Logic:
  - Print the Time
  - Change the Time
  - Compare times
  - Convert time object to an integer

Two software development methodologies
  - Prototype and path: a development plan that involves writing a rough draft of a program, testing, and correcting error as they are found

  - Designed development: a development plan that involves high level insight into the problem and more planning than incremental development or prototype development

Quick Aside: Types of functions

  Pure function: a function that does not modify any of the objects it receives as arguments. Most pure functions are fruitful

  Modifier: A function that changes one or more of the objects it receives as arguments. Most modifiers are void; that is, they return none

  The type of functions we designed for our time class are pure functions


Review: object-oriented programming

  Python is an oop language
  3 decisions
  1. what object to model
  2. What properties do they have
  3. What actions can you perform on the object

Methods:

  - Class objects can have attributes

  e.g.
    - String Class
    - Turtle Classes
    - Dictionary Class
      given a dictionary, use dictionaryName.key() and then print(dict_key)


Special Methosd

  Python provides extra functionality w/ special methods you can add to Classes

  Special methods gie more control over class, and can integrat it with ython's language features

  all special method names begin and end with double underscores e.g. __init__()

  Features of special methods:
    - Initialize your object as it is being created
    - Type conversion
    - Operator overloading

Special Methods: __init__()

  The __init__() method is special becaue python automaticall calls it as an obj which is being instantiated

  If we add parameters to the __init__() method, then those parameters become required in order to instantiate an object

  We can use __init__() method with our Time class as a way of making hours, minutes, and seconds requiredto create a Time object

  e.g.

  class Time:
    def __init__(self, hours = 0, minutes = 0, seconds = 0):  ## this is the python alternative to multiple constructors through optional (default) parameters
      self.hours = hours  ## self refers to the object itself
      self.minutes = minutes
      self.seconds = seconds

      t = Time(3) ## hours will be set to 3 everything else to default
      t2 = Time(seconds = 2) ## seconds will be set to 2 everything else default

Special methods: __string__()

  The __str__() method is special because Python automatically calls it whenever it tries to convert an object to a string

Special methods: Operator overloading

  Operator overloading: changing the behavior of an operator like + so it works with a programmer-defined Type

  We can define operator overload methods in a class to allow it to be used with operators
    e.g.

    We can overload operators such as relational operators or regular operators (+, -, /, *, etc.)

Type-based dispatch(similar to guardian case) - programming pattern that checks the type of an operand and invoke different functions for different types

operand on the left always determines the operator method to call (e.g. __add__, etc.)
  ** to account for this, every operator has reversed overloads

  Syntax:

  __radd__() is the reversed overload method for __add__()
